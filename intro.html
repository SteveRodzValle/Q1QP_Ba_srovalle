        <div class="p"><p>The increasing integration of digital technology in high school students' lives has raised concerns about the impact of screen time on their daily routines and overall well-being. This study goes beyond quantifying the number of hours students spend in front of screens; it delves into the reasons behind their screen use, the types of content they engage with, and the potential positive or negative outcomes associated with their screen time.  
            This research aims to provide insights into the average screen time of high school students and its implications for their education and well-being. This knowledge can guide the development of strategies and policies that balance the benefits of technology with the need for a healthy, well-rounded high school experience.</p></div>
