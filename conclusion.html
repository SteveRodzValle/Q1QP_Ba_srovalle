        <div class="par1"><p>The Average Screen Time of our respondents in the data is roughly 8.1 hours. By adding the screen time of our respondents then dividing the sum by the count of the numbers, we were able to find the average screen time. According to sources such as reidhealth.org and mykidsvison.org, the average screen time for children and teens ranging from the ages 8-12 and 12-15 is two or less hours.</p></div>
        <div class="par2"><p>However, the study has potential limitations, such as the data source not fully representing the entire high school student population in the Philippines, self-reporting being subject to recall bias, and not delved into the content or context of screen time. By understanding the extent of screen time among students and its potential consequences, we can better address the challenges associated with screen use in modern times.</p></div>
